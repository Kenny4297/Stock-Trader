## Description
A fun CLI stock trader simulator where the user can buy and sell stocks from the Fortune Global 1000 list. The user can either log in (use an existing account) or sign in and create an account. Their information (stocks, remaining cash) is all saved in a .json file for long term persistance. 

## Motivation
I wanted to have a simple Python project to showcase for possible employers

## Technologies
Python (with a desire to add Tkinter for user GUI)

## Features
The program stores the user and stocks data
