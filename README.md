## Description
A fun CLI stock trader simulator where the user can buy and sell stocks from the Fortune Global 1000 list. The user can either log in (use an existing account) or sign in and create an account. Their information (stocks, remaining cash) is all saved in a JSON file for long term persistance. 

## Motivation
I wanted to have a simple Python project to review my Python skills and push myself with a new project!

## Technologies
Questionary for creating lists with user input. Perhaps using TKinter for a GUI?

## Features
The program stores the user and stocks data in a JSON file, and can retrieve that information whenever is needed. The stocks value will change once a day cycle (when the user is done buying stocks that day), and can continue playing if he likes. Future plans on creating a 'high score' that ranks the players wallet after x number of days played?
