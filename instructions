Caveats: Stocks should go up or down randomly by a certain percent between (down 20% or up 30%).

Also, it should handle every kind of invalid input.

You will want to test it with various kinds of invalid inputs. Invaid inputs are both invalid types (letters, etc.) and invalid values (numbers out of range).


Part 2
———————————

Program should take an optional argument (use sys.argv) which specifies how many companies there are available to buy. Valid numbers range 1-1000. 

So essentially, your program should generate X number of companies (or 1 default) and they should be real company names.

Each company’s stock should go up or down independently from each other.
